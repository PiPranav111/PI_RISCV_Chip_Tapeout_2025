👋 Hi, I’m Pranav Indurkar

🎓 I am a full-time M.Tech VLSI Design student at COEP Technological University.
💡 Passionate about semiconductor technology, chip design, and fabrication, I am continuously learning and exploring the open-source EDA ecosystem.

🚀 Why I Joined the Program

This program is a unique opportunity for me to:

Gain hands-on experience with open-source VLSI tools

Understand the complete RTL-to-GDSII design flow

Collaborate with a large community of enthusiastic learners & professionals

Contribute to India’s semiconductor ecosystem through open-source initiatives

🎯 My Objectives

📚 Build strong foundations in RTL, synthesis, and physical design

🔧 Master open-source tools like Yosys, OpenLane, Magic, Ngspice

🏗️ Work on real-world SoC design projects

🌍 Share my learning openly to help others in the VLSI community

🌟 Aspirations

Become an industry-ready VLSI professional

Contribute to semiconductor R&D and fabrication in India

Take part in tapeout programs and work towards silicon implementation

Inspire more students to adopt open-source tools in chip design

🙏 Acknowledgment

I am grateful to the VLSI System Design (VSD) team for creating this program and providing a platform for learners like me to contribute, learn, and grow.

📌 Next Step: My repo will track progress week-by-week, starting from environment setup (Week 0) to physical design and tapeout preparation.
